# CIM-Identities
CIM example database code
Documentation on creating an easily accessible database for CIM using PostgreSQL for the database and Java for the GUI interface.
Potential for web application.

Go to the "SQL and Java code docs" folder for SQL code to generate a database in PostgreSQL and Java code for connecting to the database and creating a Swing form.

Go to the "CIM_Database_AccesJar" folder for an executable version of the Java code. Probably won't work without a matching database.
